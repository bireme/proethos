<h3>ProEthos</h3>


ProEthos is an innovative platform for ethics review of human subjects research. 
ProEthos was developed by PAHO in collaboration with the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná (Brazil) 
to facilitate the review process of ethics committees. ProEthos improves the quality of ethics review 
and the accountability, transparency and efficiency of review processes. Ultimately, ProEthos improves 
the protection of research participants and catalyzes ethical research.

ProEthos is an online system that allows researchers to submit their studies for ethics review electronically. 
Committees then conduct the ethics review with the help of the tools included in ProEthos. 
The system keeps track of every step of the review process. Finally, ProEthos allows committees to monitor approved studies.

ProEthos is free and adapts easily to the processes of each committee. It can be downloaded into each institution’s server 
or used on a cloud server. The information uploaded in the system is 100% confidential as no one 
but the entity downloading the system will have access to it.
