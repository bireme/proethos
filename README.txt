README for ProEthos
===================

ProEthos is an innovative platform for ethics review of human subjects research and
it was developed by PAHO in collaboration with the Pontifical Catholic University of
Paraná (Brazil) to facilitate the review process of ethics committees. This platform
improves the quality of ethics review and the accountability, transparency and 
efficiency of review processes, and ultimately improves the protection of research
participants and catalyzes ethical research.

It is an online system that allows researchers to submit their studies for ethics
review electronically. Committees then conduct the ethics review with the help of the
tools included in the system that, in turn keeps track of every step of the review
process. Finally, ProEthos allows committees to monitor approved studies.

ProEthos is free and adapts easily to the processes of each committee. It can be 
downloaded into each institution’s server or used on a cloud server. The information
uploaded in the system is 100% confidential as no one but the entity downloading the
system will have access to it.
